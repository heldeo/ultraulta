       "\"\\nhello guys it's me Nikki hey are you\\ndoing how many of you have been\\nfollowing me since this week now for\\nthose of you who are new here you should\\nknow that my 11 year anniversary is\\ncoming up I've been doing the entire\\nYouTube game for 11 years at the end of\\nJune and it inspired me to kind of look\\nback and see what changed\\nI want to take a trip down memory lane\\nand look at my techniques look at my\\nproducts that I loved using and just\\nlook at what I was like in 2014 and I'm\\ndoing so in a little challenge called\\nthe then versus now makeup challenge and\\nit's literally where you go back in time\\nand you show on one side of your face\\nwhat you used to do like technique-wise\\nproduct-wise what your face used to look\\nlike back in the day versus your current\\ntechniques your current favorite\\nproducts and what you really like to do\\nwith your style nowadays I'm going back\\nto the year 2014 to the month of July\\nwhere I uploaded a bright rainbow eye\\nmakeup look and I know that especially\\nin the eyes department my techniques\\nhave really shifted and I want to see\\nwhat I used to do so prepare for a lot\\nless lip filler different teeth and a\\nway more insecure little Niki and let's\\ngo back in time okay this should be\\ninteresting especially since we're\\nstarting off with the base and I know\\nthat especially in the base department\\nI've come a long way like a bit like a\\nlong way I'm looking at the video called\\nsummer sunset smokey eyes makeup\\ntutorial I gives all the keywords you\\ncan girls today I'm gonna go for my face\\nand body by Mac in c1 I don't think so\\nhoney okay there are a whole lot of plot\\ntwists going on right now first of all\\nno primer\\nsecond of all one of the most\\nsheer coverage foundations in my entire\\ncollection and then also applying with a\\nbrush I have found the foundation\\ncombination first off the face of body\\nfoundation by Mac this is amazing if\\nyou're doing portfolio work if you're\\ndoing like high-fashion makeup because\\nyou want the skin to look like skin and\\nthen wherever I need more coverage I\\nsaid I'm going in with the Bobbi Brown\\nSkin Foundation stick and I'm in the\\ncolor zero okay so let's not prime and\\ndive straight in and I'm just gonna\\nstart tapping this on and as you can see\\nthat gives you no coverage at all can't\\nwait hold on for just one second there\\nis no change\\nit just looks wet on this side nothing\\nchanged I mean clearly I wasn't loving\\nmyself because I gave myself nothing to\\nwork with here this is shine now I need\\nto remind myself not to you know kind of\\nshift into my new habits I need to apply\\nthis like I would back in the day oh\\ngirl why a brush you're not Lisa\\nEldridge okay time for concealer okay\\nokay prolong\\nokay how did I apply that with a brush\\nI remember using this combination\\nfrequently and thinking I don't know\\nwhere my makeup is then holding up well\\nfirst of all girl where's your primer\\nsecond of all girl this foundation is\\nnot for you honey it is not for your\\nskin so after I'm setting my face\\nusing this chanel universally but a\\nloose powder and 20 Claire and I use\\nthis for years upon years I thank the\\nLords of makeup we're in the present\\nmakeup days and it's time for a full\\ncoverage beat first primer and I need a\\nhardcore primer that is gonna have my\\nface looking nice all day long until I\\ndecide I want my makeup to go away for\\nfoundation the more coverage the better\\nso I'm going in with the dubious place I\\nam magic foundation in Bali oh yes oh\\nhoney I'm home for concealer I am using\\nthe dirtiest place I am magic concealer\\nand number 22 and I definitely am not\\nafraid to like really amp it up\\nunderneath my eyes guys nothing beats\\nblending in your base products with a\\nsponge it just for me it hides the\\nappearance of my pores it makes the\\nfoundation and the skin become one it\\njust creates this like flawless illusion\\nthat I love so much when it comes to\\nmakeup and then of course I'm setting\\nusing my holy girl powder Fanta beauty\\nbutter\\nI know from back in the day I would\\nalign my brows so I would place a line\\nunderneath a line at the top I would\\nfill in everything in between using a\\nPaint Pot put some clear brow gel on and\\ncarve out the bottom and call it a day\\nand to me that was like the perfect brow\\nit wasn't you know nowadays I give\\nmyself a fuller looking brow I give\\nmyself individual hairs at the front\\nlike I have a fool like if I could write\\na novel about how I do my brows nowadays\\nI would so I remember going in with a\\ntaupe eyeshadow and just linings\\nliterally putting two lines now I would\\nfill this in using a paint pot by Mac in\\nthe color Taylor gray and I would just\\nfill this in and brush it in and that's\\nit my brothers come such a long way and\\nI thought I was killing the game and\\nthen I would carve them out using my Mac\\nPro Longwear concealer that is sad that\\nis compared to how much love I put in my\\nbrows nowadays this is this is sad this\\nis even more sad than the final episode\\nof Fame with references this is this is\\nheartbreaking so just for the sake of\\nshock value I'm just gonna do my other\\nbrow off camera now so you can see the\\nvast difference in one second get ready\\nfor a brow glow up in three two one\\ntada this is everything my heart desires\\nwhen it comes to my brows and this is\\nit's just not that there's necessarily\\nanything wrong with it it's just this is\\nlike the full fantasy and this is like\\ndreaming about having a fantasy alright\\ntime to move on to the eyes now if\\nyou've been an ogee follower you know\\nthat Mac soft ochre Paint Pot used to be\\none of the sentences I would say in\\nevery single video for years upon years\\nupon years upon years I wouldn't\\nliterally get comment saying the day you\\nstop wearing soft ochre Paint Pot is the\\nday\\nyou stop doing makeup and I have\\ndeparted from soft ochre so much that I\\ndon't have it in my collection right now\\nguys are gonna be so real with you I'm\\nscared I don't know if I can still do\\nshadows the way I used to do them\\nbecause I have created this technique\\nnow that I know works for my eye shape I\\nknow what kind of shape really works for\\nmy eye shape I know how to enhance and\\nwhen I look back at this video I'm going\\nin with my first lid shade lids first\\ncrease after this is insanity\\nso I remember the sugarpill shadows\\nbeing my everything back in the day I\\nmean look at how much of the pan is\\nshowing up I always use these when I\\nwanted a bright shade because I feel\\nlike these were the only bright shades\\non the market that were super pigmented\\neasy to work with and just gave you that\\nlook and we're starting off with the\\nyellow on the lid so packing this on and\\nlike I also said in the video I'm going\\nup towards my crease but not higher than\\nthat now after the years have progressed\\nand I have started to sort of understand\\nmy hooded eyes a bit more I know that\\nonce I go past my crease and create my\\nown crease my own fake crease it totally\\nopens up my eyes but it's interesting to\\nsee how over the years you start\\nunderstanding your shapes a bit more now\\ngoing in sugar pills flame point and you\\nguessed it that is going into the middle\\nalso going up to the crease and like I\\nsaid only going up to the base of my\\ncrease and not any higher than that\\nnext sugar pill color this is dolly pop\\nand that is going on the outer third\\nmeeting up with the orange tapping this\\non blending it in with the orange and\\nagain only going about the\\nfar up because that was my crease and\\nthat was what I was gonna stick to with\\npoison plum I'm kind of going to make my\\nshape by creating an outer V so I'm\\nmaking a little line here and from there\\ngoing into my crease and they also want\\nto start blending that with the pink so\\nthat is super interesting how before the\\nshape came after filling in my lid\\nwhereas now the first thing I do is go\\nin with my crease color and determine\\nthe shape from there do I go for rounded\\ndo I go for it cat eye do I go for blown\\nout and smoky everything nowadays for me\\nshape wise starts with the first step\\nand here I just you know slapped my lid\\non and then I was like okay let's see\\nwhat we're gonna do next and again this\\nis going into my crease but honey I\\ndidn't go far up at all like I just\\nplaced this purple above the pink but\\ndid that tell me to go a bit higher up\\nabsolutely not\\nI am literally having the hardest time\\nblending in the purple and the pink\\nseamlessly because it all is so dry like\\nthe base is not tacky like things are\\njust not sticking things are patchy\\nthings are not working around and the\\nbiggest plot twist of this eye is that\\nI'm kind of leaving that purple in place\\nand then I go in with like this muted\\norange yellowish shade to buff out the\\ncrease out of nowhere I'm like what am i\\ndoing so grabbing this sort of like\\nmuted yellowy orange II shade and\\nbuffing this into the crease this is a\\nmess and then you want to look down and\\ncreate this new inner corner\\nlike that I know it looks really strange\\nright now but it will tie in together at\\nthe end see even in 2014 I was already\\ncreating new in a corner taking the\\npurple now I'm gonna try and stop my\\nfuture self my Curtin self from pulling\\nthis too far down because I went the\\nlowest bit downwards and I thought I was\\nbeing super smoky with it so I am\\ncontrolling myself I feel like I'm\\nalready going way too far down yeah I'm\\nprobably going way too far down okay\\nand now it's time to do the eyeliner\\nwork then just make a really thick cat\\nwinged eyeliner and just follow along\\nokay so we're doing extension on the\\ninner corner with liner doing a fat wing\\nI feel comfortable doing that let's do\\nthat for my lower lashes I'll be using\\nmy Mac extended play gigablack lash no\\nuse cuts all Cecily's oh Beauty glimmery\\nstuff that was like the softest lash I\\nhave worn since that video probably okay\\nso I'm just gonna do all of that real\\nquick I'll finish up this eye and then\\nit's time to see how I would do a smokey\\nrainbow cat eye in the present day\\nliterally anyone who watches my videos\\nnowadays knows that I am obsessed with\\nthe P Louise base to start off my eye\\nwith I call it the Optimus Prime portion\\nof the eye look and ever since I've\\nstarted using this my eye shadow game\\nhas changed now like I mentioned what I\\ndo nowadays is I start off in my crease\\nand I just stand my color in and focus\\non the shape after that I focus on\\nblending and perfecting everything and\\nmaking it look bomb but the first step\\nfor me always is my crease nowadays so\\nI'm picking up a pink shade and I'm just\\nstamping this into my crease and getting\\nall that pigment on there and already\\nlike almost further up than the other\\neye because over the years I have\\nlearned that with my hooded eyes I just\\nhave to take it up to give myself that\\ndrama something I also never used to do\\nis looking straight into my mirror so\\nkeeping the mirror straight in front of\\nme and looking straight into it and just\\nkind of placing the color in my crease\\nand above it and with this I am making\\nsure that whenever I'm just looking like\\nmy normal self you still see what is\\nhappening in my crease usually with all\\nmy other looks that I did in the past my\\ncrease is like the same sort of like\\ntaupey brown is shade and all you would\\nsee was my topaz brownish shade in the\\ncrease and all the fun stuff I had going\\non on the lid you would only see if I\\nblinked my eyes and now I want to make\\nsure that I showcased what I worked very\\nhard on so I have determined the shape\\nusing my crease color and now with\\nwhatever is left in that brush I go up\\nagainst the edge and apply soft\\nminiature motions except miniature\\ncircular motions to buff out that edge\\nand now I start working on my blend also\\none of my all-time favorite tricks to\\nmake my hooded eyes kind of connect to\\nmy nose contouring and to make\\neverything look more deep-set and open\\nis apply that same blending shade\\ntowards the front of the brow so right\\nhere I just brush it circle it into the\\nfront of my brow and that has completely\\nchanged my eye game the palette I've\\nbeen using for this site by the way is\\nthe secret Center by P Louise and I'm\\nactually taking that purple addicted now\\nto go on the outer corner and I just\\nstart stamping that on to the outer\\nthird of my lid and crease and swooping\\nit out alright and then now cutting the\\nlid using the P Louise basic and winter\\nrose\\nand setting that using a nice sparkly\\npinky peach pigment meant to define that\\ncut crease even more and add more\\nrainbow and going in with the senti\\nbeauty\\nbanana banana blaze liner these liners\\nare life some yellow on the inner corner\\nand again over the years I've kind of\\nlearned to really blow up that inner\\ncorner to make my eyes appear larger for\\nthe lower lash line I'm picking up that\\npurple again and applying it right here\\nat the outer corner and connecting the\\nouter corner towards this top portion\\nhere following with the pink and then\\nnow would be the time for me to do a\\nblack liner extend that inner corner add\\na little bit of white to really you know\\ncreate the illusion but look at the\\ndifference in height and blending and\\ngradiation like I'm not saying in any\\nway that this is bad it's not good\\neither but it's not like horrible but\\nthis is like the glow up can we take a\\nsecond to see the massive difference\\nbetween the two I feel like with my\\npresent techniques my eye looks bigger\\nmore in charge and like it has power\\nbaby whereas the other side again not\\nnecessarily bad but it's like yeah so\\nlook at that crazy difference now let's\\nmove on to cheeks now when it comes to\\ndoing my face back in 2014 I had\\nabsolutely no clue what I was doing\\nbecause my base the face and body was so\\nsort of wet that as soon as I went in\\nwith the brush I created holes in my\\nfoundation like it started moving and\\nseparating and it just it was a messy\\nold time so what I would do back in the\\nday is bronze my cheeks\\nperiod I wouldn't bronze my forehead I\\nwouldn't bronze my nose I wouldn't\\nbronze anywhere else because as soon as\\nI would go in with a brush my foundation\\nwould leave the chat so I'm taking my\\nbronzer on a big Brush\\nand I'm just gonna brush it in back then\\nI wish I knew how I lift my cheeks\\nnowadays because I would just kind of\\nbronze like this and see how a low down\\nit goes now I actually have techniques\\nwhere I really lift my face and stuff so\\nI wish I knew back then so see after I\\ndid this how it brought back some of the\\nlittle spots here like how it brought it\\nback because it have raced the\\nfoundation this used to be like the bane\\nof my existence back in the day overtop\\nof that I would add contouring and for\\nthe longest time I would use my NYX\\nblush in taupe for this Bobbi Brown\\nblush in the color wheat number 30 so I\\nwould go in and not go high up because I\\ndidn't know and just follow along the\\nbronzer and like put it way too low well\\nI do have to say that this Bobbi Brown\\nshadow and wheat is a beautiful\\ncontouring color like I might have to\\nbring him back into my life ok guys I'm\\nreally excited about this part just\\nwatch how different I do my cheeks now\\nso I go in with a bronzer and I tap it\\nalmost where I would highlight so where\\nyou would highlight your cheekbones I\\nkind of put my bronzer there and I just\\nstamp it on and make little circles but\\nI never take it further in than sort of\\nthe center of my eye then of course that\\nten head needs to become a forehead so I\\nfinally have a base that allows me to\\nput bronzer here and to create the\\nillusion now for that exact same reason\\nblush was like scary territory for me\\nbecause I was like I'm just gonna bring\\nback the redness in my face because I'm\\nliterally pushing away my foundation I\\nwould apply the teensiest tiniest bit\\njust for the camera to look like I was\\ndoing much but I wasn't really doing\\nmuch and I would put it right here on\\nthe apple of my cheek a really smile\\nding-ding-ding-ding-ding hit that Apple\\nand pull it back now I just kind of\\nblended in with the bronzer that I just\\napplied and make it one and of course on\\nmy channel a look wouldn't be completed\\nwith\\nlittle bit of glow and just highlight\\nwith that first now Eva back in 2014\\nhighlighter was one of my favorite\\nthings to do with my makeup routine one\\nof my favorites used to be mary lou\\nmanizer by the balm and I would always\\napply it using a morphe fan brush I\\ndidn't have that anymore so I just take\\na fluffier big brush dig my finger in\\nthere and kind of create my own little\\nfan brush and I would just highlight\\nright here boom lately I've been really\\nliking the extra dimension skin finish\\nby Mac and double gleam and I pick it up\\non a sort of slanted highlighter brush\\nand I go nuts so I place it right here\\nwhere you kind of see the reflection of\\nthe product already going on I just\\nreally enhance that and play it up and\\nthen lately for that glass skin kind of\\nlook I pull it towards the top of my lip\\nhere and that gives you that nice glass\\nskin feel and then I also put some on\\nthe center of my forehead a little bit\\non the chin and I always did the tip of\\nthe nose so I can just do that freely\\nwhat I never did on my 2014 side is do\\nthis portion here so I am doing that\\nnowadays all the time so I'm just gonna\\ntry and put that on one side baby oh\\nthose cheeks got an upgrade baby just\\nlook at the difference pulled up and\\nlift it and like hi time for lips and\\none thing if you've truly been an OG\\nfollower of mine you're gonna know what\\nthis is this is Mac lip erase and this\\nwas my staple products my entire life\\nI've had super pigmented red lips and\\nit's something that I like always want\\nto take every dove and all I did all day\\nwas erase any single little bit of color\\nfrom my lips we put this on your lips\\nand it completely blanks out all color\\nand the movement I'm doing right now\\nthis this would be me every hour for\\nlike five years of my life if you ask my\\nmom pretty much my youth\\ndup in one gesture is this I would\\nalways apply this I put a gloss over top\\nyeah I wish I was kidding but my lips\\nwould look like this with a gloss over\\ntop this nude this deadly I mean the\\npaler the better looking back now honey\\nthat was not a good look\\nno lining no lipstick just the lip erase\\nand the gloss and I felt like I could\\ntake on the world nowadays I have a full\\nlip journey going on\\nso first let's line okay let's do a nice\\nnude lipstick to blend in with the liner\\nand gloss and there we have with the\\nmassive difference five years can make\\nin a makeup look I think this is what\\nmakeup is all about because even though\\nI feel like this side right now is like\\nmy my big winner maybe five years from\\nnow I look at this side and I go oh girl\\noh girl I think that is what is so\\nfascinating fun and exciting about\\nmakeup is that you never ever stop\\nlearning if you think you've nailed it\\nall you're not even close\\nand I think that is one of the things\\nthat has always kept me interested in\\nmakeup for 11 years is that it always\\nputs me on my toes and I always want to\\nlearn more and new things and this is\\nthe proof of that now without any\\nfurther ado I think I have a very\\nfitting Dutch word of the day for\\ntoday's video of course in my last video\\nthe Dutch word of the day was for\\ndiversity D fair she ties asked for\\ntoday's Dutch word of the day it can\\nonly be one word the past fair Laden\\nthere lay then this side of my face is\\nin the present but this side it's for\\nNATO if you want to be featured in my\\nnext video all you have to do is leave a\\ncomment down below including the Dutch\\nword of the day or leave a video\\nresponse on Instagram under the hashtag\\nDutch word of the day good luck\\nI want to thank you so so so much for\\nwatching this video I had such a blast\\ndoing this I hope you enjoyed and\\nhopefully I will see you guys on the\\nnext one bye guys\""
