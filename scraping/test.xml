<p begin="00:08:08.190" end="00:08:13.720" style="s2">guys are gonna be so real with you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.750" end="00:08:15.789" style="s2">scared I don&#39;t know if I can still do</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.720" end="00:08:17.680" style="s2">shadows the way I used to do them</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.789" end="00:08:20.410" style="s2">because I have created this technique</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.680" end="00:08:22.000" style="s2">now that I know works for my eye shape I</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.410" end="00:08:24.550" style="s2">know what kind of shape really works for</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.000" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">my eye shape I know how to enhance and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.550" end="00:08:30.610" style="s2">when I look back at this video I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:34.450" style="s2">in with my first lid shade lids first</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.610" end="00:08:36.430" style="s2">crease after this is insanity</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.450" end="00:08:38.890" style="s2">so I remember the sugarpill shadows</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.430" end="00:08:41.110" style="s2">being my everything back in the day I</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.890" end="00:08:44.529" style="s2">mean look at how much of the pan is</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.110" end="00:08:46.720" style="s2">showing up I always use these when I</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.529" end="00:08:48.430" style="s2">wanted a bright shade because I feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.720" end="00:08:50.410" style="s2">like these were the only bright shades</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.430" end="00:08:53.350" style="s2">on the market that were super pigmented</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.410" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">easy to work with and just gave you that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.350" end="00:09:00.670" style="s2">look and we&#39;re starting off with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:09:04.089" style="s2">yellow on the lid so packing this on and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.670" end="00:09:09.820" style="s2">like I also said in the video I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.089" end="00:09:12.940" style="s2">up towards my crease but not higher than</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.820" end="00:09:15.339" style="s2">that now after the years have progressed</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.940" end="00:09:18.010" style="s2">and I have started to sort of understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.339" end="00:09:20.830" style="s2">my hooded eyes a bit more I know that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.010" end="00:09:24.400" style="s2">once I go past my crease and create my</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.830" end="00:09:26.230" style="s2">own crease my own fake crease it totally</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.400" end="00:09:28.540" style="s2">opens up my eyes but it&#39;s interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.230" end="00:09:30.730" style="s2">see how over the years you start</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.540" end="00:09:33.970" style="s2">understanding your shapes a bit more now</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.730" end="00:09:36.810" style="s2">going in sugar pills flame point and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.970" end="00:09:40.150" style="s2">guessed it that is going into the middle</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.810" end="00:09:44.050" style="s2">also going up to the crease and like I</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.150" end="00:09:47.470" style="s2">said only going up to the base of my</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.050" end="00:09:50.020" style="s2">crease and not any higher than that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.470" end="00:09:54.750" style="s2">next sugar pill color this is dolly pop</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.020" end="00:09:59.709" style="s2">and that is going on the outer third</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.750" end="00:10:03.100" style="s2">meeting up with the orange tapping this</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.709" end="00:10:06.570" style="s2">on blending it in with the orange and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.100" end="00:10:09.480" style="s2">again only going about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.570" end="00:10:11.460" style="s2">far up because that was my crease and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.480" end="00:10:14.910" style="s2">that was what I was gonna stick to with</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.460" end="00:10:18.390" style="s2">poison plum I&#39;m kind of going to make my</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.910" end="00:10:20.820" style="s2">shape by creating an outer V so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.390" end="00:10:25.500" style="s2">making a little line here and from there</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.820" end="00:10:27.750" style="s2">going into my crease and they also want</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.500" end="00:10:29.970" style="s2">to start blending that with the pink so</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.750" end="00:10:32.340" style="s2">that is super interesting how before the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.970" end="00:10:34.380" style="s2">shape came after filling in my lid</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.340" end="00:10:36.660" style="s2">whereas now the first thing I do is go</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.380" end="00:10:38.580" style="s2">in with my crease color and determine</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.660" end="00:10:40.650" style="s2">the shape from there do I go for rounded</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.580" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">do I go for it cat eye do I go for blown</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.650" end="00:10:45.630" style="s2">out and smoky everything nowadays for me</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:48.660" style="s2">shape wise starts with the first step</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.630" end="00:10:50.040" style="s2">and here I just you know slapped my lid</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.660" end="00:10:52.080" style="s2">on and then I was like okay let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.040" end="00:10:55.200" style="s2">what we&#39;re gonna do next and again this</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.080" end="00:10:59.250" style="s2">is going into my crease but honey I</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.200" end="00:11:04.230" style="s2">didn&#39;t go far up at all like I just</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.250" end="00:11:05.850" style="s2">placed this purple above the pink but</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.230" end="00:11:07.530" style="s2">did that tell me to go a bit higher up</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.850" end="00:11:09.770" style="s2">absolutely not</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.530" end="00:11:12.330" style="s2">I am literally having the hardest time</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.770" end="00:11:15.420" style="s2">blending in the purple and the pink</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.330" end="00:11:17.700" style="s2">seamlessly because it all is so dry like</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.420" end="00:11:20.130" style="s2">the base is not tacky like things are</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.700" end="00:11:22.560" style="s2">just not sticking things are patchy</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.130" end="00:11:24.960" style="s2">things are not working around and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.560" end="00:11:27.480" style="s2">biggest plot twist of this eye is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.960" end="00:11:29.850" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of leaving that purple in place</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.480" end="00:11:31.860" style="s2">and then I go in with like this muted</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.850" end="00:11:33.630" style="s2">orange yellowish shade to buff out the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.860" end="00:11:36.090" style="s2">crease out of nowhere I&#39;m like what am i</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.630" end="00:11:39.980" style="s2">doing so grabbing this sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.090" end="00:11:42.390" style="s2">muted yellowy orange II shade and</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.980" end="00:11:44.430" style="s2">buffing this into the crease this is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.390" end="00:11:48.290" style="s2">mess and then you want to look down and</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.430" end="00:11:48.290" style="s2">create this new inner corner</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.390" end="00:11:55.350" style="s2">like that I know it looks really strange</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.310" end="00:11:58.200" style="s2">right now but it will tie in together at</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.350" end="00:12:07.530" style="s2">the end see even in 2014 I was already</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.200" end="00:12:11.820" style="s2">creating new in a corner taking the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.530" end="00:12:14.190" style="s2">purple now I&#39;m gonna try and stop my</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.820" end="00:12:17.370" style="s2">future self my Curtin self from pulling</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.190" end="00:12:19.500" style="s2">this too far down because I went the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.370" end="00:12:21.510" style="s2">lowest bit downwards and I thought I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.500" end="00:12:23.250" style="s2">being super smoky with it so I am</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.510" end="00:12:25.650" style="s2">controlling myself I feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.250" end="00:12:27.510" style="s2">already going way too far down yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.650" end="00:12:29.220" style="s2">probably going way too far down okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.510" end="00:12:31.290" style="s2">and now it&#39;s time to do the eyeliner</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.220" end="00:12:35.100" style="s2">work then just make a really thick cat</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.290" end="00:12:37.440" style="s2">winged eyeliner and just follow along</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.100" end="00:12:39.930" style="s2">okay so we&#39;re doing extension on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.440" end="00:12:43.470" style="s2">inner corner with liner doing a fat wing</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.930" end="00:12:52.380" style="s2">I feel comfortable doing that let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.470" end="00:12:54.750" style="s2">that for my lower lashes I&#39;ll be using</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.380" end="00:12:58.050" style="s2">my Mac extended play gigablack lash no</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.750" end="00:13:00.750" style="s2">use cuts all Cecily&#39;s oh Beauty glimmery</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.050" end="00:13:04.980" style="s2">stuff that was like the softest lash I</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.750" end="00:13:06.870" style="s2">have worn since that video probably okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.980" end="00:13:09.240" style="s2">so I&#39;m just gonna do all of that real</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.870" end="00:13:12.450" style="s2">quick I&#39;ll finish up this eye and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.240" end="00:13:14.940" style="s2">it&#39;s time to see how I would do a smokey</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.450" end="00:13:17.280" style="s2">rainbow cat eye in the present day</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.940" end="00:13:20.340" style="s2">literally anyone who watches my videos</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.280" end="00:13:22.680" style="s2">nowadays knows that I am obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.340" end="00:13:25.350" style="s2">the P Louise base to start off my eye</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.680" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">with I call it the Optimus Prime portion</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.350" end="00:13:28.950" style="s2">of the eye look and ever since I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:35.610" style="s2">started using this my eye shadow game</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.950" end="00:13:38.520" style="s2">has changed now like I mentioned what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.610" end="00:13:40.860" style="s2">do nowadays is I start off in my crease</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.520" end="00:13:43.110" style="s2">and I just stand my color in and focus</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.860" end="00:13:45.300" style="s2">on the shape after that I focus on</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.110" end="00:13:47.550" style="s2">blending and perfecting everything and</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.300" end="00:13:51.210" style="s2">making it look bomb but the first step</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.550" end="00:13:53.850" style="s2">for me always is my crease nowadays so</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.210" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">I&#39;m picking up a pink shade and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.850" end="00:14:02.360" style="s2">stamping this into my crease and getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:04.070" style="s2">all that pigment on there and already</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.360" end="00:14:07.100" style="s2">like almost further up than the other</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.070" end="00:14:09.380" style="s2">eye because over the years I have</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.100" end="00:14:11.540" style="s2">learned that with my hooded eyes I just</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.380" end="00:14:13.820" style="s2">have to take it up to give myself that</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.540" end="00:14:16.820" style="s2">drama something I also never used to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.820" end="00:14:18.800" style="s2">is looking straight into my mirror so</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.820" end="00:14:21.140" style="s2">keeping the mirror straight in front of</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.800" end="00:14:23.870" style="s2">me and looking straight into it and just</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.140" end="00:14:26.690" style="s2">kind of placing the color in my crease</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.870" end="00:14:29.899" style="s2">and above it and with this I am making</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.690" end="00:14:32.540" style="s2">sure that whenever I&#39;m just looking like</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.899" end="00:14:34.490" style="s2">my normal self you still see what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.540" end="00:14:36.890" style="s2">happening in my crease usually with all</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.490" end="00:14:38.480" style="s2">my other looks that I did in the past my</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.890" end="00:14:40.490" style="s2">crease is like the same sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.480" end="00:14:42.769" style="s2">taupey brown is shade and all you would</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.490" end="00:14:44.540" style="s2">see was my topaz brownish shade in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.769" end="00:14:46.459" style="s2">crease and all the fun stuff I had going</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.540" end="00:14:49.550" style="s2">on on the lid you would only see if I</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.459" end="00:14:52.610" style="s2">blinked my eyes and now I want to make</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.550" end="00:14:55.250" style="s2">sure that I showcased what I worked very</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.610" end="00:14:57.290" style="s2">hard on so I have determined the shape</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.250" end="00:15:00.260" style="s2">using my crease color and now with</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.290" end="00:15:02.480" style="s2">whatever is left in that brush I go up</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.260" end="00:15:06.070" style="s2">against the edge and apply soft</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.480" end="00:15:10.190" style="s2">miniature motions except miniature</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.070" end="00:15:18.350" style="s2">circular motions to buff out that edge</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.190" end="00:15:20.449" style="s2">and now I start working on my blend also</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.350" end="00:15:22.130" style="s2">one of my all-time favorite tricks to</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.449" end="00:15:23.630" style="s2">make my hooded eyes kind of connect to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.130" end="00:15:25.670" style="s2">my nose contouring and to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.630" end="00:15:29.060" style="s2">everything look more deep-set and open</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.670" end="00:15:33.529" style="s2">is apply that same blending shade</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.060" end="00:15:37.490" style="s2">towards the front of the brow so right</p>

<p begin="00:17:47.700" end="00:17:51.750" style="s2">doing my face back in 2014 I had</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.040" end="00:17:55.170" style="s2">absolutely no clue what I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.750" end="00:17:57.240" style="s2">because my base the face and body was so</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.170" end="00:17:59.460" style="s2">sort of wet that as soon as I went in</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.240" end="00:18:01.320" style="s2">with the brush I created holes in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.460" end="00:18:03.360" style="s2">foundation like it started moving and</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.320" end="00:18:05.160" style="s2">separating and it just it was a messy</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.360" end="00:18:07.340" style="s2">old time so what I would do back in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.160" end="00:18:10.500" style="s2">day is bronze my cheeks</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.340" end="00:18:11.640" style="s2">period I wouldn&#39;t bronze my forehead I</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.500" end="00:18:13.440" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t bronze my nose I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.640" end="00:18:15.750" style="s2">bronze anywhere else because as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.440" end="00:18:17.310" style="s2">I would go in with a brush my foundation</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.750" end="00:18:19.410" style="s2">would leave the chat so I&#39;m taking my</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.310" end="00:18:22.020" style="s2">bronzer on a big Brush</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.410" end="00:18:24.600" style="s2">and I&#39;m just gonna brush it in back then</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.020" end="00:18:26.700" style="s2">I wish I knew how I lift my cheeks</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.600" end="00:18:29.730" style="s2">nowadays because I would just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.700" end="00:18:32.850" style="s2">bronze like this and see how a low down</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.730" end="00:18:35.490" style="s2">it goes now I actually have techniques</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.850" end="00:18:38.220" style="s2">where I really lift my face and stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.490" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">I wish I knew back then so see after I</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.220" end="00:18:43.110" style="s2">did this how it brought back some of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:44.760" style="s2">little spots here like how it brought it</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.110" end="00:18:48.000" style="s2">back because it have raced the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.760" end="00:18:50.130" style="s2">foundation this used to be like the bane</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.000" end="00:18:52.110" style="s2">of my existence back in the day overtop</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.130" end="00:18:54.930" style="s2">of that I would add contouring and for</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.110" end="00:18:57.360" style="s2">the longest time I would use my NYX</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.930" end="00:19:01.020" style="s2">blush in taupe for this Bobbi Brown</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.360" end="00:19:03.750" style="s2">blush in the color wheat number 30 so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.020" end="00:19:06.060" style="s2">would go in and not go high up because I</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.750" end="00:19:09.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t know and just follow along the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.060" end="00:19:11.250" style="s2">bronzer and like put it way too low well</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.480" end="00:19:13.920" style="s2">I do have to say that this Bobbi Brown</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.250" end="00:19:15.720" style="s2">shadow and wheat is a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.920" end="00:19:18.210" style="s2">contouring color like I might have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.720" end="00:19:19.650" style="s2">bring him back into my life ok guys I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.210" end="00:19:22.410" style="s2">really excited about this part just</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.650" end="00:19:25.320" style="s2">watch how different I do my cheeks now</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.410" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">so I go in with a bronzer and I tap it</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.320" end="00:19:30.300" style="s2">almost where I would highlight so where</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:33.660" style="s2">you would highlight your cheekbones I</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.300" end="00:19:36.690" style="s2">kind of put my bronzer there and I just</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.660" end="00:19:39.360" style="s2">stamp it on and make little circles but</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.690" end="00:19:42.780" style="s2">I never take it further in than sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.360" end="00:19:46.110" style="s2">the center of my eye then of course that</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.780" end="00:19:49.920" style="s2">ten head needs to become a forehead so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.110" end="00:19:53.130" style="s2">finally have a base that allows me to</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.920" end="00:19:55.140" style="s2">put bronzer here and to create the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.130" end="00:19:59.520" style="s2">illusion now for that exact same reason</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.140" end="00:20:01.800" style="s2">blush was like scary territory for me</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:03.660" style="s2">because I was like I&#39;m just gonna bring</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.800" end="00:20:05.940" style="s2">back the redness in my face because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.660" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">literally pushing away my foundation I</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.940" end="00:20:10.740" style="s2">would apply the teensiest tiniest bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:12.060" style="s2">just for the camera to look like I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.740" end="00:20:13.980" style="s2">doing much but I wasn&#39;t really doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.060" end="00:20:16.890" style="s2">much and I would put it right here on</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.980" end="00:20:19.350" style="s2">the apple of my cheek a really smile</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.890" end="00:20:21.960" style="s2">ding-ding-ding-ding-ding hit that Apple</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.350" end="00:20:25.080" style="s2">and pull it back now I just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.960" end="00:20:28.590" style="s2">blended in with the bronzer that I just</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.080" end="00:20:30.690" style="s2">applied and make it one and of course on</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.590" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">my channel a look wouldn&#39;t be completed</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.690" end="00:20:34.139" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:39.600" style="s2">little bit of glow and just highlight</p>
